### [Scraper repo](https://github.com/afaf98/Vampire_diaries_API/tree/development/scraper)

The Scraper repository contains how we get the data and how we normalize them, in order to insert the information scraped in the database.

### [Frontend repo](https://github.com/afaf98/Vampire_diaries_API/tree/development/client)

Here you can find the API explorer, created with ReactApp, where you can request data if you are in posses of a key.
You may also request one in the form at the end of the page

### [Backend repo](https://github.com/afaf98/Vampire_diaries_API/tree/development/server)

This repository contains how the database is structured and the end to end test created to make sure that the App is working properly even with changes.

# Goals

The main Goal of this project was to create an open source api that allow you to collect data from a specific TV show that is called The Vampire Diaries.


# The learning goals in this project are the following :

 - ## Scrape & Normalize data

  All the data in this API has been scraped from a website.
  That allowed us to create a good amount of data to build this project. 

  - [Scraper Folder](https://github.com/afaf98/Vampire_diaries_API/tree/development/scraper)
 
 - ## Build a rest API with database

To accomplish our aim we've start building a Rest API, by creating different databases (Development/Testing/Production) with Sequelize and Postgres.
All the releations of the tables has been defined and implemented.
It has been implemented an Express server that allowed us to create different routes by following the Rest rules. 

  - [Server Folder](https://github.com/afaf98/Vampire_diaries_API/tree/development/server)

  - ## End to end test rest api

To make sure our app works and keeps working in the proper way, we've implemented a testing section.
For the testing we've installed Supertest and Jest, that allowed us to create end to end testing.

  - [Testing files](https://github.com/afaf98/Vampire_diaries_API/tree/development/server/test)

  -  ## Validate incoming requests

  Each request has been validated by using a library [Yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup).
  Validation was an important step to make sure that the app works properly and to give a the right feedback to the user.

  - [Validation example](https://github.com/afaf98/Vampire_diaries_API/tree/development/server/validation)

  
  - ## Sending emails

Our API requires an Api Key, that allows the user to use all the routes available.
To request a key we've created an POST request that sends an email to the new User with the personal key.
For this functionality we've used [SendGrip](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sendgrid/mail)

- [Example sending email](https://github.com/afaf98/Vampire_diaries_API/blob/1ae705c6d2c636874eefbffae34232d615f795a2/server/sendEmail.js)

## Simple React-App

To build our frontend we've decided to use React app that allowed us to create different components and build a simple app.

For the styling we've decided to use a [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) with some customization applied with CSS
  - custom hook & context
  - Bootstrap
  - Continuous integration / Continuous deployment 
  - Github actions run e2e tests
  - Heroku auto deploy / Netlify auto deploy
  - Main / Dev / Feature git flow

### User Stories

- As a User I want to be able to fetch the sesaons/episodes and charachters from the API
- As a User I want to be able to sort the data by ascending or descending order
- As a User I want to be able to fetch the data with a precise limit/offset
- As a User I want to be able to request an ApiKey
- As a User I want to be able to Query the database to find specific data
